consider the following series are:
1,1,2,3,4,9,8,27,16,81,32,243......
this series is a mixture of two series-all the odd term in this series form a geometric series and all the even terms form yet another geometric series.Write a program to find the Nth term in the series.
Qs 2.)
Find the 15th term of the series?
0,0,7,6,14,12,21,18, 28
Explanation : In this series the odd term is increment of 7 {0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 – – – – – – }
And even term is a increment of 6 {0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 – – – – – – }
